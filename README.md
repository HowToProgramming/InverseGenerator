# InverseGenerator
I want to release this for every osu!mania LN player, this one can generate in only parts and there is an LN gap option

How to use ?
You need to bookmark the start and the end of the Inverse Generation parts (it can be one or many parts up to you)
Run the Client, click "Open File" then choose the file to do the inverse (it needs to be bookmarked)
Click "Show all bookmarks" then enter LN Gap for each bookmarks (default 1/4)
Click "Inverse !" and refresh osu!
Have fun !
